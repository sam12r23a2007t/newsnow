                    leave for your favourite destination. However, that won’t be the case for Microsoft employees in the
                    US as the tech giant has modernised its vacation policy and is offering unlimited time off to its
                    employees along with other leaves. That means that the salaried employees in the US won’t have a
                    fixed number of vacation days and can take unlimited leaves for the same.</div>

Last week, Alon Gal, co-founder of Israeli cybersecurity-monitoring firm Hudson Rock posted on LinkedIn that he had discovered stolen data, which contained email addresses of more than 200 million Twitter users. Gal wrote that the data was posted on an online hacking forum and that the breach would likely lead to “hacking, targeted phishing and doxxing,” and termed it a ‘significant leak.’ He said that Twitter had not responded to him when he had alerted the company about the same.</div>
